Process A's address space consists of 100  pages. This process uses fork to create two children processes, B and C. The operating system employs copy-on-write to efficiently use main memory and reduce the overhead of process creation. Process A then modifies 2 different pages, followed by process B modifying 5 different pages. The total number of pages needed to store the address space of all three processes is equal to:To what extent do DNN-based image classification models make unreliable inferences?
