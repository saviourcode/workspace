A certain set of tasks is identified by the long-term scheduler to be a good mix for multiprogramming. It consists of some CPU-bound tasks and some I/O-bound tasks. The combination is suitable to ensure high utilization of both the CPU and I/O devices. Over time, the processing capacity and speed of CPUs keeps improving at a must faster rate than the speed of I/O devices. Would this same mix of tasks continue to be suitable for high utilization of all components of the computer? Explain.
